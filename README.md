# SuperHot - Unity Remake

A Unity-based recreation of SuperHot's core experience, focusing on its iconic time manipulation mechanics and combat replay features to deliver the unique "time as a weapon" tactical shooting gameplay.

# Core Features

## Time Manipulation System

A innovative time-flow mechanic: time slows to a near halt when the player stands still, and resumes normal speed during movement, aiming, or attacksâ€”giving you ample tactical space to plan every move.

## Combat Replay Functionality

Automatically records every detail of each battle, including movement paths, shooting timings, and kill moments. Instantly review your best plays after combat ends.

# How to Play

* Movement: Use WASD keys to move your character.
* Aim: Drag the mouse to adjust your view and aim your weapon.
* Shoot: Left-click to fire your current weapon.
* Throw Weapon: Right-click to throw your equipped weapon.
* Reset Level: Press R to restart the current level.

# Upcoming Plans

## Online Multiplayer (In Development)

Planned support for 2-4 player online battles, including cooperative missions and competitive modes. The time manipulation mechanic will be synchronized across players to enable new team-based tactics.
